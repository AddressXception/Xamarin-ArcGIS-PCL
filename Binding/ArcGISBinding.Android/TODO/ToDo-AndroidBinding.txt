Unfortunately due to licensing the ArcGIS Runtime is not redistributable.  You'll have to add it.
Add a folder:

Jars

To the root directory of this project 
and copy the following jar files from the SDK:

ArcGIS_Android.jar (may be named something different)
jackson-core-lgpl-1.9.5,jar
jackson-mapper-lgpl-1.9.5.jar
